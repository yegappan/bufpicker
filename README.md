BufPicker
=========

Plugin to display the list of buffers in the quickfix list.

The buffer names are sorted by their last used timestamp. As you edit buffers, the quickfix list is refreshed to reflect the latest buffer list.

To open the quickfix window with the list of buffers, use the `:BufPicker` command. In the quickfix window, you can press `<Enter>` on a buffer name to edit the buffer.
